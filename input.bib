Abstract = {Modern and contemporary transhumanism has seen a recent rise in academic
   and popular relevance; specific naive metaphysical ideas, such as
   immortality, have returned with this rise. This article refrains from
   any ethical or political assessment of transhumanism. Still, it
   critiques the exact metaphysical or idealistic nature of transhumanism
   and its pursuit of digital immortality: the idea that, through
   technological advancements, precisely in Artificial General
   Intelligence, an immortal virtual ``self{''} will become possible. The
   article follows the form of Immanuel Kant's ``Paralogisms{''} from the
   Critique of Pure Reason, where Kant is concerned with the substantial,
   immortal nature of the soul and its experiential impossibility. The
   article will offer theoretical and practical paralogisms (false logical
   inferences), arguing that the transhumanist claim that digital
   immortality is possible fundamentally stems from two incorrect major
   premises. The first concerns the substantial nature of information,
   which informs the theoretical paralogisms; the second concerns infinite
   transformation (pure plasticity), which informs the practical
   paralogisms},

Abstract = {The United Nations Panel on Digital Cooperation, 2019, has emphasized
   the inclusive growth of digital networks and digital public goods,
   utilizing a multistakeholder systems approach. Similarly, the
   information and communications technology (ICT) Innovation and
   Intervention Program of the Government of India's Digital North East
   Vision 2022 has also emphasized a need for inclusive growth of ICT in
   the Northeast Region. In line with the above, this article presents
   insights from a field study conducted in the rural parts of Manipur,
   India, which incidentally can be found to be applicable to many rural
   parts of the developing world. The article envisions a community-driven
   sociodigital transformation of the Northeast Region of India. In this
   quest, the article highlights sociopolitical challenges for digital
   transformation and provides insights for inclusive ICT in such
   regions-infrastructure as a utility for every citizen, smart governance
   and services on demand, digital empowerment of citizens, social welfare,
   capacity building, and community engagement.},

Abstract = {One of the issues with which bioethics is concerned is defining the
   limits of the organism's transformations by technology in order for
   humanity to avoid evil. Kant's teleological power of judgment enables us
   to identify an organism and it allows nature to be transformed only
   insofar as it affirms a moral subject acting on the basis of autonomy as
   reason. I propose a new way of utilizing Kantian philosophy in
   bioethical knowledge. I ask: can we make judgments about nature via the
   principle of purposiveness? In answering this question, I clarify the
   following points. The first is Kant's research into the foundations and
   reasons for using the teleological power of judgment. The second is the
   role of digital technology and how it complicates the use of the
   teleological power of judgment within the framework of bioethical
   knowledge. And the third is the preservation of the foundations for
   using the teleological power of judgment.},

Abstract = {Kant's transcendental idealism was the beginning of the end of the
   telluricall philosophy of Being and its replacement by the cosmological
   philosophy of Nothing. Possessing the maximum of possibilities, Nothing
   is the highest expression of a priori and digitalism. The ontological
   correlate of Nothing is the concept of the Cosmos as a designation of
   any spheres where there is no life, the Universe and the Metauniverse.
   I. Kant is the first fundamental philosopher, he can be considered a
   speculative harbinger of the computer science, virtualism and cosmism
   as: 1) care orientation (fly away) into the galactic lifeless reality,
   2) creating a bit-atomic, entirely artificial reality on Earth, in the
   limit, its transformation into a dead planet. And postmodernism, as a
   humanitarian and speculative reflection of the beginning digital
   transformation of life into technos, humanism into transhumanism,
   transition of human consciousness into posthuman intelligence. The
   humanitarian significance of Kant's philosophy in its culture and
   antropological inconsistency as live Genus homo. The ideology of human
   survival can be the philosophy of telluric realism in the modality of

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has proved a powerful catalyst for the integration
   of digital technologies in everyday life. Many digital routines have
   replaced the traditional ones relating to purchasing goods and services,
   information exchange, movement, document issuance, or scheduling medical
   appointments. Despite technology proliferating through society, the
   digital divide is widening. The place of residence is a factor affecting
   the involvement in digitalisation, along with age, education, income,
   and the availability of ICT infrastructure. This study evaluates the
   readiness of the population of various Russian regions to embrace
   digital technologies. Based on a comparative analysis of traffic to the
   most popular websites on the Russian Internet, grouped into five
   categories (e-commerce, e-government, information exchange, spatial
   mobility, scholarly commu- nication), an index method for assessing
   readiness for digitalisation is developed. The study uses Yandex search
   data from February 2019 to January 2021. The findings suggest that
   Russian regions may be divided into digitally advanced areas,
   runner-ups, average performers, and the digital periphery.
   Recommendations are given on how to increase readiness for digital
   transformation in territories of different types without running the
   risks of forced digitalisation.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on both national
   economies and everyday life. Massive lockdowns and a shift towards
   digital technologies forced people to adapt to technological innovations
   in their daily routines in a new online format. In this study we
   identify patterns of change in the population's adoption of and
   receptiveness to digitalization. The focus is on registering the
   expansion of digital routines influenced by the coronavirus depending on
   the place of residence, infrastructure and demographics. The results of
   a population survey held in August 2020 across all municipalities of the
   Kaliningrad region of Russia suggest that the magnitude of the
   pandemic's effect in accelerating digitalization is different for
   various population types. Most receptive to digital innovations are
   residents of economically developed municipalities aged 26-40 with
   higher education having a stable Internet connection at a fair price.
   The article presents a typology of municipalities on the adoption of and
   receptiveness to innovation. It is shown that without the established
   infrastructure, technological, economic, cultural and behavioural basis,
   the acceleration of digitalization does not occur.},

Abstract = {The article explores opportunities for the sustainable economic
   development of coastal territories in the Baltic Sea region (BSR)
   arising in blue economy sectors in the framework of digital
   transformation. The study argues that a more active commercialisation of
   territorial resources can facilitate the sustainable economic
   development of the BSR coastal territories, following digitally-driven
   innovations. The paper provides an overview of methodological approaches
   to territorial sustainability. It also assesses the 2009-2018 level of
   the socio-economic development of the BSR coastal territories, underpins
   the importance of the blue economy and highlights the role of digital
   transformation in reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
   in the BSR through digitally-driven innovations. A comparative and
   problem-targeted statistics analyses show significant differences in the
   level and dynamics of socio-economic development in the BSR coastal
   territories with their GRP per capita being generally lower than the
   national or macroregional average. A review of literature on sustainable
   development in the BSR has shown that a more active use of unique
   resources of the coastal territories along with a technology-driven
   growth of blue economy sectors can counterbalance the negative impact of
   the territories' uneven development on the progress towards the SDGs in
   the BSR. Increasing the competitiveness of the BSR coastal territories
   requires investment in digital solutions in the blue economy sectors and
   the creation of a communication infrastructure. The review of key
   innovations in the blue economy sectors shows that their implementation
   gives impetus to other industries by reducing costs, creating new jobs,
   and improving the quality of products and services.},

Title = {MEMORY IN THE DIGITAL SPACE AS A FORM OF THE ``CARE OF THE SELF{''}},
Journal = {LOGOS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {34},
Number = {6},
Pages = {113-134},
Abstract = {The article offers an attempt to conceptualize contemporary practices of
   digital resurrection of the subject in the context of the emergence and
   spread of chatbots based on artificial intelligence. Digital resources
   of constructing the subject's digital image in a dialogical form carry
   out the mediating function of remembering, producing and generalizing
   ``texts of life.{''} Actual forms of recollection in the dynamics of
   individual memory are analyzed, and different levels and meanings of the
   contemporary discourse of the subject's digital resurrection are
   developed. Recollection is considered both as a technologically unified
   practice of permanent actualization of memory about an individual and as
   a result of constructing a personal image intended for postmortem
   broadcasting and processing in digital space. The creation of a digital
   copy of the deceased, constructed according to a single, unified
   template, is presented as one of the actual ways of forming
   representations of the individual's past. The variety of modern
   technological developments (test/startups and final commercial
   products), which design and broadcast the postmortem image of a person
   in digital mode, is presented and analyzed. The ideas of Pierre Nora,
   Jan Assmann, Aleida Assmann, Michel Foucault, Geert Lovink, Hermann
   Lubbe, and Theodor W. Adorno are touched upon. The article also
   problematizes the notion of subjectivity through the prism of
   imperatives and standards underlying such a concept as the ``care of the
   self.{''} Practices of the ``care of the self{''} include the aspect of
   remembering: the requirement of forming one's own biography, its
   transmission, and the construction of memories of the image of a
   physical and digitalized person. The following conclusion is formulated:
   private forms of the ``care of the self{''} in digital space are
   practices of reactivation of the subject, actualization of memory about
   him/her on the basis of approved representing components. The strategy
   of constructing memories refers to a standardized, technicalized,
   streaming mechanism of reproducing digital models. However, this
   mechanism allows the existence of a digital trace to actualize the
   memory of the physical ``medium{''} by reducing digital ``cloning{''} to
   the transformation of the repetitive into the inimitable, the serial
   into the unique. The memory becomes a technical overproduction of the
   living, the result of the subject's own assemblage in a greater
   perspective.},

Title = {CROSS-BORDER DIGITALIZATION OF THE WESTERN BORDER OF RUSSIA: POTENTIAL
   AND PROSPECTS},
Journal = {BALTIC REGION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Pages = {90-108},
Abstract = {Border regions are significant geostrategic territories, which long-term
   sustainable development is one of the priorities of Russia's national
   security. The specificity of their economic-geographical position
   necessitates the development and implementation by the authorities of
   special governance approaches aimed at finding a balance between the
   openness and barrier function of the state border. One of the most
   common tools for the spatial development of border areas is the
   sustainable cross-border cooperation with the regions of neighboring
   countries using various froms of cross-border cooperation, incl. focused
   on the generation and diffusion of innovations. The covid-19 coronavirus
   pandemic, having become a truly global challenge of our time, has made
   significant changes not only in the policies of many countries regarding
   the border, but also in the functioning of already established
   cross-border regions. The impossibility of fully implementing the
   previous formats of interethnic and interregional interaction has
   necessitated the search for new forms of cooperation, primarily based on
   the use of rapidly developing digital technologies. This led to the
   growth of academic and practical interest in substantiating the mutual
   effects of digitalization, innovation and internationalization for the
   regions. This article is devoted to assessing the potential and
   prospects of cross-border digitalization of the Western borderland of
   Russia. The objectives of the study were to identify the gap between
   border regions in the level of accessibility and penetration of digital
   technologies, as a significant condition for the formation of
   cross-border digital connections. The object of study is 15 subjects of
   the Russian Federation and 17 regions of NUTS 2 neighboring states.
   Using geoinformation and statistical methods of analysis, a typology of
   regions by the value of the digitalization index is proposed, with the
   allocation of leaders, moderate and lagging regions, and an assessment
   of their spatial location relative to the state border. Possible reasons
   for the current digital inequality, primarily of a socio-economic
   nature, are discussed. The determining role of the institutional factor
   in realizing the potential of cross-border digitalization has been
   substantiated. It is concluded that political efforts for digital
   convergence in the western direction are being undertaken only between
   Russia and Belarus, although further intensification is required.},

Title = {DOMINANTS, SUBDOMINANTS, AND RECEDENTS: A FORMAL ANALYSIS OF
   TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE CANONICAL REPRESENTATION OF 19th CENTURY GERMAN
   PHILOSOPHY},
Journal = {LOGOS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {30},
Number = {6},
Pages = {173-206},
Abstract = {The history of philosophy was a persistent interest in 19th century
   Germany. Ulrich Schneider lists 148 original works in the history of
   philosophy by 114 authors published from 1810 through 1899. The scale of
   this historiographic tradition makes it suitable for analysis through
   digital humanities techniques ({''}distant reading,{''} formal analysis,
   and innovative visualizations). This paper uses that body of
   publications to show how the canon of the history of German philosophy
   in the 19th century was formed and how it evolved.
   In order to uncover patterns in the attention devoted to particular 19th
   century philosophers, the authors undertook a formal analysis of 77
   tables of contents from German textbooks in the history of philosophy.
   They used the results of their analysis to classify philosophers into
   three groups with metaphorical labels drawn from ecology: dominant,
   subdominant, and recedent. In addition to confirming the dominance of
   the ``Big Four{''} (Kant, Fichte, Schelling, and Hegel), the analysis
   provides a more nuanced picture of the period under consideration. For
   example, during the 1830s and 1840s, opinions about the significance of
   certain philosophers became highly polarized. In some textbooks Johann
   Friedrich Herbart was completely ignored, while in others his ideas were
   explored in more pages than those of Hegel. Kant's writings attracted
   increasing attention after 1860. His share of pages increased as the
   number devoted to most other philosophers was dwindling. Fichte,
   Schelling and Hegel lose nearly half of their pages and fall closer to
   the subdominant category that included ilerbart, Schleiermacher, and
   Schopenhauer. Original visualization techniques provide a graphical
   representation of the changes in the canon of 19th century German
   philosophy.},

Title = {``DIGITAL TRACES{''} AS AN INDICATION OF THE POPULATION'S INTEREST IN
   THE BORDER REGIONS OF RUSSIA FOR CROSS-BORDER CONTACTS},
Journal = {POLIS-POLITICHESKIYE ISSLEDOVANIYA},
Year = {2022},
Number = {3},
Pages = {157-175},
Abstract = {In the context of the neighborhood policy, border territories act as
   natural contact zones, the population of which is most interested in the
   development of cross-border relations and the strengthening of trusted
   relations. In some regions, this is linked to a common historical and
   cultural past, in others - to incentives of a socio-economic nature, for
   example, relatively lower prices for certain categories of goods and/or
   services, developed cultural and leisure infrastructure, and the
   possibility of economic profits. Moreover, each of the areas of
   cooperation (industrial, tourism, cultural, environmental, innovation,
   etc.) has its own set of indicators for assessing the intensity of
   cross-border contacts, which gives only a fragmentary idea of the
   general interest of the population of border regions in cross-border
   cooperation. The purpose of this study is to assess the general level of
   interest of the population of the border regions of Russia in
   cross-border contacts by using computational social science. The
   resource Yandex Wordstat was employed as an information base on the
   `digital traces' of users. The data coverage period is 2020-2021. The
   results of the analysis of 308 unique user requests in the context of 42
   border regions of Russia revealed some asymmetry in the degree of their
   integration into the information space of neighboring states. It
   revealed that in most cases users from the border regions of the Russian
   Federation are more active than the country average in looking for
   information about the border regions and cities of neighboring states.
   The geographic directions for which the most and least interest in
   cross-border cooperation arise among the population of the Russian
   borderlands are presented.},

   RUSSIA},
Journal = {BALTIC REGION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Pages = {140-166},
Abstract = {Digital transformation of socio-economic processes is the basis for
   sustainable devel-opment of regions in the digital age. The foundation
   for such a transformation is the information and communication
   infrastructure and, first of all, the mobile Internet. The technological
   growth of mobile networks has provided a rapid increase in the number of
   users around the world, contributing to further digitalization. With the
   development of digital technologies, research in the field of human
   geography has received a new impe- tus. The impact of the Internet on
   all spheres of life has necessitated a rethinking of the existing
   geographical approaches to the study of physical space and the emergence
   of a new object of research - digital space. On the one hand, the latter
   is closely connected with traditional institutions and systems. On the
   other hand, it is characterized by its own patterns of construction and
   functioning. The problem of delimiting the boundaries of cyberspace
   makes it difficult to manage digital processes taking into account
   territorially determined needs and interests, while the current
   socio-economic unevenness of regional development results in the digital
   divide. Border regions, maneuvering within the dichot-omy of `frontier -
   integration bridge' models, can gain additional benefits from the de-
   velopment of digital infrastructure in the context of realizing their
   integration potential. This article assesses the geography of the mobile
   internet in Russia and its connection with the development of border
   regions. The authors use geo-information, statistical, and econometric
   analyses to assess the impact of mobile technologies on interregional
   infor-mation transfer, commodity-money flows, and migration. The study
   demonstrates the di- versity in the availability of mobile internet
   access among residents in various categories of border and interior
   regions. Furthermore, the research establishes a link between the
   quantity of transmitted digital data, the import-export of goods and
   services, internation-al migration, and two key metrics: the
   accessibility of 4G mobile internet and the number of mobile
   subscribers. The article pinpoints specific border regions within the
   Russian Federation, including Krasnodar Krai, Leningrad, Kaliningrad,
   Novosibirsk, Smolensk, Rostov, Chelyabinsk, Voronezh, Samara, and Kursk
   regions. These regions exhibit pro-nounced potential for executing
   integration functions through the advancement of digital technologies,
   particularly under favourable geopolitical conditions.},

   these scholars have demonstrated the power of Kant's essay and its

   authorship and copyright, they have also underestimated the material
   dimension of the text that affords the production of its meaning. A more
   adequate understanding of Kant's text and how it could illuminate the
   present digital transformation of authorship and copyright would require
   that we attend closely to its medial-materialities.},

   Problems and Prospects},
Journal = {PROPOSITOS Y REPRESENTACIONES},
Year = {2021},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {At present, the Internet and its mediated communication are an integral
   part of everyday life and social networks are becoming the main platform
   for self-presentation these days. The main tool for such self-expression
   in social networks is the selfie. The rapid rise in the popularity of
   selfies suggests that the very practices of self-representation are
   undergoing a major historical transformation. Research purpose is to
   study the features of selfies construction. Research methods: as a
   research method, a questionnaire survey was used as a method that allows
   quickly and effectively to investigate the features of using selfies as
   a way of constructing a digital personality. Research results: the
   article considers the forms of body control in social networks in the
   practice of constructing selfies. Research novelty and originality lies
   in the fact that for the first time the practice of selfies as a way of
   constructing a digital personality is considered. It is shown that
   selfidentification is based on how the body is evaluated, and not on
   what it is actually. It is revealed that the body has become a carrier
   of meaning and a platform for communication with feedback, and the
   Internet, which has become the main repository of global data sets, has
   assumed the role of this communication control over the body. It is
   determined that in understanding the essence of the selfie phenomenon,
   there are two points of view: the selfie, as a continuation of the
   tradition of self-portrait and the selfie, as a special unique
   phenomenon associated to a greater extent with network media content. It
   is revealed that the main motive of self-presentation is the desire to
   be socially approved, to get the highest rating and the most flattering
   or loud comment. It is revealed that the hashtag is one of the
   structural elements of the selfie, through which the process of
   constructing the image is carried out. It is shown that an important
   motive for constructing a selfie is the user's need for a certain visual
   statement, self-expression. It is determined that in the production of
   selfies, the user is often guided by fashion trends and ready-made
   templates, which means that by regulating the real body in space, a
   successful representation of the digital body in the network is formed.
   The practical significance of the data obtained in this work lies in

Abstract = {The article provides a brief description of the history of the search
   for the image of the ``ideal journalist{''}. It is noted that
   researchers record the list of competencies necessary for the successful
   professionalization and socialization of a university graduate, a novice
   journalist in different ways. The lack of unity of views on the problem
   raises the question of which journalist should be trained by modern
   universities, taking into account the new social demand. The purpose of
   the article is to determine the basic characteristics of the image of
   the ``ideal journalist{''}, taking into account the latest
   socio-cultural transformations and changes in journalism. As a rule,
   scientists start from the imperative of I. Kant about the moral ideal.
   However, modern socio-cultural changes force us to expand the list of
   necessary qualities, to reconsider traditional views on the
   ``exemplary{''}, that is, the ``ideal{''} journalist, which, in turn,
   requires a certain revision of the concept of modern media education.
   Based on the data obtained within the framework of a moderation seminar
   held within the walls of SurGPU and a survey of 375 respondents
   (students, media educators and practicing journalists), the authors
   identified a number of contradictions in the vision of the ideal image
   by journalists themselves and social demand (in the context of
   digitalization of the media field). Journalism students, as well as
   media professionals, do not attach much importance to the threats posed
   by digitalization of the media, and often ignore the advantages that it
   provides (using digital tools when working with Big Data, in the process
   of preparing media products and their targeted broadcast to recipients).
   We believe that focusing the attention of media educators on the
   existing contradictions in the perception of the ideal image of a modern
   journalist will allow us to adjust the modern media educational model,
   take into account the latest socio-cultural transformations.},

Abstract = {This article questions the author-centred conceptualization of
   copyright's subject matter in defining the scope of protection. It
   focuses on films, the medium's communicative nature, and user
   interactions with films in the digital age. The analysis starts with
   Kant's definition of a book as a `public speech' and adapts it to films.
   The article states that the publicness of the medium comes with user
   expectations. It states that, in many cases, the audience's interaction
   with films starts with the expectation of a further communication
   through the work. The article then explores the intercommunication of
   the audience, its transformation in the digital age, and its role in
   shaping our cultural landscape. The conclusion is that, in order to
   answer the demands of the new habits of communications, new ways of
   research, and any novelty that comes with future technologies, copyright
   law needs to acknowledge the participatory nature of user interactions
   with cultural works and how those interactions shape our culture.},

Abstract = {This paper begins with an overview of the origins and development of
   ancient direct participatory ``democracy{''} and a related concept of
   the ``public.{''} Through the Roman ``res publica{''} and the ``homo
   publicus{''} and much later the Magna Carta and the English tradition of
   participatory rights, as well as the French ``division of powers{''} and
   the French Revolution and Kant's ``public usage of reason,{''} a rather
   modern concept of the ``public{''} in representative modern democracies
   developed in the Enlightenment and materialized in the nineteenth and
   twentieth centuries. In social and political philosophy there was a
   noticeable impact of ``the public{''} and ``public life{''} in debates,
   formal constitutions and their philosophical and pragmatic foundations.
   Dewey's lectures on ``The Public and its Problems{''} already emphasized
   the impact and the growth of communication technologies for ``the
   public,{''} publicity, political and social life. Habermas diagnosed a
   ``Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere{''} from a pragmatic
   social philosophical point of view, although he did not really take up
   Dewey's diagnoses and predictions of the role of media and communication
   technologies. The same is true for Gerhardt's study The Public: The
   Political Form of Consciousness (2012). With the pervasive impact of
   digital communication and media technologies there has occurred another
   structural transformation of the public sphere and the concept of the
   public. Instant global multimedia communication certainly has largely
   positive effects, fostering social as well as individal freedom and even
   revolutionary changes. But there are also the widespread experiences of
   individual and group mobbing, ``shitstorms,{''} cyber-crimes, electronic
   spying and data-mining, etc. The structure (the concept and reality) of
   the public has lately been and is currently rapidly changing again due
   to the electronic information revolution.},

   tasks on the green channel of the retinal image. A combination of
   morphological operations like top-hat and bottom-hat transformations are
   applied on the preprocessed image to highlight the blood vessels.
   Finally, the Kohonen Clustering Network is applied to cluster the input
   image into two clusters namely vessel and non-vessel. The performance
   ofthe proposed method is tested by applying it on retinal images from
   Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE) database. The
   results obtained from the proposed method are compared with three other
   state of the art methods. The sensitivity, false-positive fraction (FPF)
   and accuracy of the proposed method is found to be higher than the other
   methods which imply that the proposed method is more efficient and

Abstract = {This article aims to extend the traditional Ecological Interface Design
   (EID) process. With the rapid pace of digitalization in technological
   systems, there is a need for a design process that can handle the
   systemic design goals and the experiential basis of interaction.
   Currently, the traditional EID is well-positioned to address these
   challenges. However, methodologically, it needs to be substantiated to
   make it accessible for designers, designing for novel arenas, such as
   Industry 4.0. Further, substantiating the design process will help
   designers, engineers, and human factors researchers with an accessible
   pathway that links the design brief to the final interface form.
   Therefore, this article delves into the ``design{''} basis in the work
   of the Riso group and other prominent EID researchers and practitioners.
   In addition, it draws from a variety of themes in the discipline of
   design that addresses methodology. In particular, key insights are drawn
   from the design methods movement (1960s-); design, communication, and
   complexity from the Ulm school of design, 1953-1968; cognitive research
   conducted on designers and design activities; and finally, interaction
   design and communication design processes and models. All of these
   insights have been used syncretically to create the new integrated EID
   (iEID) process. This new design process consists of nine stages divided
   into three phases of divergence, transformation, and convergence,
   converting the initial design brief to the final interface. The steps of
   iEID are demonstrated using the example of interface design for a
   ``digital twin{''} in the manufacturing sector.},

Abstract = {Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) are no longer
   hypothetical; they present significant challenges to current IT
   infrastructure by potentially breaking existing encryption schemes
   within minutes. This paper introduces an innovative and efficient method
   for achieving quantum-resistant encryption through lattice-based
   cryptography. We specifically tackle the challenge of encrypting
   extremely small units of data, such as a single letter or a single-bit
   message, by constructing a multidimensional lattice. Our proposed
   technique leverages the Short Vector Problem (SVP) in lattice-based

   for data encryption and decryption. We demonstrate the feasibility and
   robustness of this approach using a real-time messaging application that
   provides quantum-resistant end-to-end encryption. Our work has the
   potential for deployment in strategic applications, securing information

Abstract = {In this paper, an automated method for blood vessel detection from
   retinal fundus images is proposed. Initially, the method extracts the
   green layer of the retinal image as it contains the requisite
   information. The noise is removed using a noise removal filter this step
   will lead to the reduction of artifacts in the final results. The image
   features are highlighted through morphological operations i.e., top hat
   and bottom hat transformation on the preprocessed image. The resultant
   image is then clustered into two clusters representing vessel and
   non-vessel using generalized improved Fuzzy Kohonen Clustering Network
   (GIFKCN). The experiments are performed on the Digital Retinal Images
   for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE) database. The effectiveness of the
   proposed technique is analyzed using performance metrics like accuracy
   and sensitivity. A comparative study of the proposed technique with some
   of the well-known existing methods is done. The comparison shows that
   the proposed method has improved significantly. (C) 2020 The Authors.

Title = {Unraveling the impact of online consumer reviews on consumer buying
   behavior},

Abstract = {The concept of consumer reviews dates back to traditional word-of-mouth
   recommendations, which have always played a crucial role in consumer
   decision-making. However, with the advent of the internet and the rapid
   growth of e-commerce platforms, these reviews have moved online,
   becoming more accessible and influential than ever. Online Consumer
   Reviews (OCRs) have become a pivotal resource for consumers seeking
   information and advice on products and services. They offer valuable
   insights from experienced individuals, aiding potential buyers in making
   informed decisions. This transformation in consumer behavior didn't
   occur overnight but is the result of a gradual evolution in digital
   communication, e-commerce, and consumer trust.The purpose of the present
   study is three-fold: to provide a comprehensive analysis of the rise and
   popularity of online consumer reviews, to assess the impact of OCRs on
   consumer buying behavior and to identify gaps and provide
   recommendations for future research to develop a more coherent
   understanding of OCRs and their impact. To conduct a comprehensive
   assessment of previous research work on Online Consumer Reviews (OCRs),
   this study adopts an extensive literature review approach. Based on the
   extensive literature review, a conceptual framework is developed. This
   framework aims to categorize and explain three broad factors of OCRs-
   Online review credibility, source credibility and platform credibility
   that influence consumer purchase decisions. The framework serves as a
   tool for researchers to understand the triggers that result in OCRs
   impacting consumer behavior. Thus, the novel contribution of this study
   lies in its comprehensive aggregation and presentation of the most
   pertinent information on OCRs, offering a clear depiction of the current
   state of literature. This foundation facilitates the identification of
   future research opportunities, aiming to propel the field forward. Thus,
   it can be concluded that online consumer reviews have been
   revolutionized and play a major role in the decision to purchase
   products.},

Abstract = {Governments and industry leaders have already carried out programs to
   fully evaluate the strengths of blockchain and how it needs to be
   incorporated into everyday practices. Several segments performed faster
   than others. The integration of blockchain technologies into everyday
   activities within large multinationals was officially communicated, with
   the money part being the snappiest out of the squares, the promotion and
   the market part. Where integration of blockchain technologies can
   provide secure, accessible digital versions to all parties in a
   transaction, and smart contracts can be used to manage the workflow of
   approvals and automatically transfer payment upon all signatures being
   collected. As indicated by Gartner, blockchain innovation has just
   reached the height of the advertisement process and entered a time of
   decline, which is recognizing the authenticity of blockchain innovation.
   The perspective for innovation in blockchain looks magnificent and the
   increases created by acquiring the innovation are unforeseen. The
   general consensus is that passing the time of swelled desire was a
   significant advance in the transformation of blockchain across the
   infomercial process. The viewpoint for blockchain innovation looks
   splendid and the increases produced using receiving the innovation will
   be inconceivable. How the innovation is grasped will be the way to how
   it benefits the monetary markets and the world when all is said in done.},
