Abstract = {Modern and contemporary transhumanism has seen a recent rise in academic
   and popular relevance; specific naive metaphysical ideas, such as
   immortality, have returned with this rise. This article refrains from
   any ethical or political assessment of transhumanism. Still, it
   critiques the exact metaphysical or idealistic nature of transhumanism
   and its pursuit of digital immortality: the idea that, through
   technological advancements, precisely in Artificial General
   Intelligence, an immortal virtual ``self{''} will become possible. The
   article follows the form of Immanuel Kant's ``Paralogisms{''} from the
   Critique of Pure Reason, where Kant is concerned with the substantial,
   immortal nature of the soul and its experiential impossibility. The
   article will offer theoretical and practical paralogisms (false logical
   inferences), arguing that the transhumanist claim that digital
   immortality is possible fundamentally stems from two incorrect major
   premises. The first concerns the substantial nature of information,
   which informs the theoretical paralogisms; the second concerns infinite
   transformation (pure plasticity), which informs the practical
   paralogisms},

Abstract = {The United Nations Panel on Digital Cooperation, 2019, has emphasized
   the inclusive growth of digital networks and digital public goods,
   utilizing a multistakeholder systems approach. Similarly, the
   information and communications technology (ICT) Innovation and
   Intervention Program of the Government of India's Digital North East
   Vision 2022 has also emphasized a need for inclusive growth of ICT in
   the Northeast Region. In line with the above, this article presents
   insights from a field study conducted in the rural parts of Manipur,
   India, which incidentally can be found to be applicable to many rural
   parts of the developing world. The article envisions a community-driven
   sociodigital transformation of the Northeast Region of India. In this
   quest, the article highlights sociopolitical challenges for digital
   transformation and provides insights for inclusive ICT in such
   regions-infrastructure as a utility for every citizen, smart governance
   and services on demand, digital empowerment of citizens, social welfare,
   capacity building, and community engagement.},
